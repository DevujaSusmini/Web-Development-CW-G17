11. Coursework Description
    This coursework requires the following deliverables:
    • The design & development of a website as a group project, with each team member assigned
    specific tasks
    • In-Class Demonstration
    This document offers a detailed description of the requirements for each of these deliverables.
12. Website design & development
    “Our Being Westminster strategy outlines our commitment to being progressive,
    compassionate and responsible to help students and colleagues from different
    backgrounds fulfil their potential and contribute to a more sustainable, equitable and
    healthier society.
    We adopted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework to support
    this core mission and to record, measure and improve our contribution to a range of social,
    environmental and economic outcomes.”
    Figure 1 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
    Work in groups of 4 students (all group members should be from the same Web Design and Development
    computer seminar group) and design and develop a web site that focuses on introducing ONE of the 17
    United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (do not replicate the 17 UN GOALS website).
    The website must include the following pages, with each group member assigned to develop specific
    components as outlined below:
    Splash Screen Assigned to [Student 1]
    Home Page + template + nav Assigned to [Student 2]
    Volunteer Assigned to [Student 1]
    Table Assigned to [Student 2]
    User Profile Assigned to [Student 4]
    Feedback Assigned to [Student 3]
    4

Sitemap Assigned to [Student 4]
Team Assigned to [Student 3]
Content page Assigned to [all Students]
Page Editor Assigned to [all Students]
Validation page Assigned to [all Students]
While team members are assigned specific tasks to implement, it's essential for the group to collaborate in
deciding the website's content and overall look and feel.
The technical requirements for each of these pages are detailed in the following sections.
5.1. Website Style & Navigation: Assigned to [Student 2], but all
students must adhere to it
To ensure consistency across the entire website, Student 2 is responsible for creating a shared template
structure, navigation bar, and a global CSS file. This template and CSS will be used by all team members to
maintain a unified design. Detailed instructions are provided below:

1. Web site template that all the rest of the pages should adhere to including:
   • A header that incorporates the navigation bar (instruction for this are further below)
   • Content area (main) where each student will integrate the content of the pages that they have been
   assigned to create.
   • Footer (including a text that will be link to each student’s editor page, each team member will need
   to update this link to link it to their own editor’s page). All pages should be validated for acceptability.
   Each team member could also include in the pages they are responsible for compliance of their web
   pages for accessibility as part of the footer.
   • Wrapper, to allow you to add margins and center the content on the page. This creates white space,
   which makes your site easier to read, and helps it look neat and organized.
   To implement this part of the CW see Lecture notes HTML basic structure section.
2. Global CSS (as external CSS file)
   • The Global CSS file will define the main style elements of the website. Those are expected to be the
   following:
   • Styles for the structural elements of the page, header, footer, main, container if you use one, body
   style (text, heading styles, background, colour pallet for primary, secondary, and neutral colours),
   buttons and links, images (for example if they have any borders or shadow, define), navigation bar,
   cards or tiles (if you all decide to use such styling element as global style).
   • The Global CSS file should be created as an external CSS file and shared with the entire team. All team
   members are required to use this file to maintain consistency across the site.
   • Team members will have to create additional style unique elements of their pages or features not
   covered by the Global CSS file. You can define those styles as additional external, or internal CSS files.
   To implement this part of the CW see Lecture notes Styles & CSS section.
3. Navigation Bar:
   • Implement a navigation bar including links that connect all the website main pages (those are as listed
   earlier (consult the lecture notes and examples related to Links, primarily look at tutorial 3 examples).
   Do not include lings to individual student’s content pages, individual Pages Editor pages, and
   5

Validation pages from the navbar. You can find information about the naming correctly the webpages
to be able to link those together in Section 5.14 “Website folder structure, file naming & hosting [all
students]”
• The navigation bar can be integrated into the header of the website as illustrated in Figure 3.
• Using CSS to style the navigation bar as follows:
o Links can be styled as buttons or feature visual effects (e.g., a bottom border on hover) (again
consult the lecture notes related to Styling & CSS, General Page Styling).
o Add a hover effect to visually indicate links, as shown in Figure 2 (consult the lecture notes related
to Styling & CSS, General Page Styling).
o Highlight the active page (the one being viewed) using a class and appropriate CSS styling.
Figure 2 Navbar with Hover Effect and Active Page Indication
Figure 3 Two example headers that include information about the website identity combined with the navigation bar.
5.2. Splash Screen: Assigned to [Student 1]

   • Website Mission: Provide a brief statement summarizing the mission or purpose of the website.
   • Group Members: List the names of all group members clearly.
   • Background image: Provide a background image that scales to the entire splash screen.
   • DO NOT USE READY TEMPLATES FROM THE INTERNET, you have to decide as a team the look and feel of the
   website and create the corresponding CSS that will be used by all members of the team.
2. Functionality:
   • Redirection:
   6

o The splash screen should automatically redirect users to the Home page after 4 seconds, using
HTML meta tags as demonstrated in the "Automatic Redirect in Links" section of the lecture
notes.
• Animated Loader:
o Include an animated image or visual element to indicate that the Home page is loading created
with CSS.
o This enhances user experience by making the transition visually engaging. 3. Style

5.8. Sitemap: Assigned to [Student 4]
A sitemap is a visual representation of a website's structure, outlining its pages, content, and hierarchy. It
demonstrates how different pages are interconnected, helping users and developers navigate and organize
the site effectively. Sitemaps can also aid search engines in crawling and indexing content efficiently. They are
commonly presented as hierarchical diagrams, flowcharts, or XML files for search engine optimization (SEO).
17

For this coursework, you are required to create a graphical sitemap representing the structure of your
website. The sitemap must include the following features:

1. General Requirements

   hierarchical structure of your website.
   o Parent Pages: Represented as main branches.
   o Child Pages: Represented as sub-branches (see Figure 12 for reference).
   • Each page in the website should be represented as a node (e.g., a circle, rectangle, or other shape).
   • Nodes should be connected by lines (branches) to indicate the relationships between pages.
2. Interactivity
   • Each node in the sitemap must include the following interactive features:
   o Colour Change on Hover: The node should visually change (e.g., change colour or style) when
   hovered over.
   o Clickable Links: Nodes must link to the corresponding page they represent.
3. Accessibility
   • Ensure the sitemap is accessible to all users by:
   o Adding alt text to each node to describe its content.
   o Supporting keyboard navigation, allowing users to interact with the sitemap using only the
   keyboard as an alternative to a mouse.
4. Responsiveness
   • The SVG sitemap must be responsive:
   o It should scale proportionally to fit the browser window without losing clarity or functionality.
   o Ensure the design adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and
   mobile devices.
5. Integration
   • The SVG sitemap should be integrated as a standalone page within your website's design.
   • The style of the sitemap should align with the overall theme and aesthetics of your website.
   • Integration with the Website Template: The content of this page, as outlined above, should be
   incorporated into the main website template created by Student 2.
   • Footer Requirements: The footer of this page must include a link to the student’s 4-page editor.
   • Styling Guidelines: The sitemap page must adhere to the Global CSS file provided for the website to
   maintain a consistent style. Additional styles specific to this page should be created as either an
   additional external CSS file, or internal CSS within the page. These styles should be used to enhance
   and customize elements unique to the volunteering page.
   Sitemap is covered in week 5 material; however you also need to consult the lecture notes for Basic HTML tags,
   images, lists, links, forms and Styling & CSS section. Have a look primarily the tutorial 5 material for sitemaps.

   • Thumbnail Hover Effects:When a user hovers over a thumbnail, apply a visual effect such as:
   o Changing the image's alpha value (transparency).
   o Adjusting the color, border, or size of the thumbnail.
   These hover effects should make the thumbnails visually engaging and provide feedback to the user.
   • Expandable Details:
   o On hover, an associated box or section should expand to display detailed information about the
   team member, such as:
   ▪ Name.
   ▪ Role within the group.
   19

▪ Tasks they contributed to during the project.
o Refer to Figure 13 for an example, particularly the bottom middle image where extended details
are revealed interactively.
• Consult the lecture notes related to images and Styling & CSS section. Have a look at the examples in
tutorial 3. The rest of the tutorial material provide solutions for all the required elements. 3. Accessibility
• Alternative Text:
o Ensure all thumbnail images and their associated descriptions include appropriate alt text to
enhance accessibility for screen readers.
• Keyboard Navigation:
o Make the interactive thumbnails accessible via keyboard (e.g., by adding tabindex="0"). 4. Integration
• Build the page using a well-organized HTML structure, with a separate container for each thumbnail
and its corresponding extended details.
• Integration with the Website Template: The content of this page, as outlined above, should be
incorporated into the main website template created by Student 2.
• Footer Requirements: The footer of this page must include a link to the student’s 3-page editor.
• Styling Guidelines: The sitemap page must adhere to the Global CSS file provided for the website to
maintain a consistent style.
• Create additional CSS styling to:
o Use CSS to define hover effects and the visual expansion of details.
o Example styles may include smooth transitions for opacity, border, or scaling effects.
• Additional styles specific to this page should be created as either an additional external CSS file, or
internal CSS within the page. These styles should be used to enhance and customize elements unique
to the volunteering page.

5.10. Content page: Assigned to [all Students]
Each team member is required to create an
additional content page that meets the following
criteria (see Figure 14 as example):

1. Content Relevance and Length
   • The page must be relevant to your
   website's theme or topic.
   • Ensure the page has sufficient length,
   with enough content to allow for
   meaningful internal linking between
   sections.
2. Internal Linking
   • Include internal links that allow users to
   navigate to specific sections within your
   page.
   • Ensure the links work seamlessly by
   targeting specific sections using anchor
   tags or IDs.
3. Navigation for Long Pages
   • For pages longer than the screen size,
   provide an internal navigation menu:
   o Add internal links at the top or side of
   the page to help users easily navigate
   to different sections.
   o The navigation structure should be
   clear, logical, and user-friendly.
4. "Go to Top" Button
   • Include a "Go to Top" button that is
   always:
   o Visible: Positioned above all other
   content and perceptible on the page at
   all times.
   o Functional: Clicking the button should
   bring the user back to the top of the
   page. No need for JavaScript.
   • Use CSS (e.g., position: fixed) to ensure
   the button remains accessible as the user
   scrolls.

    5.13. General coursework requirements [all students]
    While team members are assigned specific tasks for implementation, it's crucial for the group to collaborate in
    determining the website's content and overall look and feel.
    9.13.1. Teamwork and Website Style Implementation
    As detailed in Section 5.1 ("Website Style & Navigation: Assigned to [Student 2], but all students must
    adhere to it"), this group project requires teamwork to ensure a consistent layout and style across the
    website. The team must collaboratively agree on the overall design, while Student 2 is responsible for
    implementing the template and Global CSS and sharing it with the team.
    Responsibilities of Student 2
14. Template Creation and Global CSS:
    • Develop an external CSS file that establishes a unified template for the website, including:
    o A standardized header featuring the website identity (e.g., logo and page title).
    o A footer where each team member can add a link to their own Page Editor.
    o General styling rules for fonts, colours, and layout to maintain consistency.
15. Navigation Bar:
    • Design and implement the navigation bar as described in Section 5.3.
    • The navigation bar must be original and created by the team; using pre-made templates from the
    Internet is prohibited.
    • All team members must follow the website file structure and the file names as explained in 5.14
    and share between the teams their user ID for the navigation bar links to work.
16. Team Collaboration:
    • Share the template and Global CSS with the team and provide clear instructions for integration.
    • Lead the design process if other team members fail to contribute ideas, ensuring a workable solution
    that aligns with the project's goals.
    Team Responsibilities
    • Integration of Assigned Pages:
    o Each team member must integrate the specific page elements they are assigned into the shared
    template and adhere to the Global CSS file.
    o Each team member will have to update the footer with links to their Page Editor and information
    about accessibility corresponding to their web pages.
    26

• Collaboration on Design:
o Actively participate in discussions to determine the website's overall look and feel.
Penalties for Non-Compliance
Failure to adhere to the shared template or Global CSS will result in penalties, as this undermines the
project's goal of consistency and teamwork.
9.13.2. Code comments
Ensure that your code is thoroughly documented with clear and concise comments to explain its functionality
and purpose.
9.13.3. Validation
All pages should be validated with no errors. Warnings are acceptable. Provide evidence that all your pages
have been validated successfully. Include screenshots or reports from the validation tool to demonstrate
compliance with web standards. Provide those in the Validation page as explained in 5.12.
9.13.4. Accessibility
All pages should be validated for acceptability. Compliance of your website for accessibility report can be
included as part of your footer.
9.13.5. Content
Feel free to use royalty free websites to find a suitable logo (https://www.istockphoto.com/), but reference
your resources.
27

5.14. Website folder structure, file naming [all students]
• The website folder should named with your team’s name that should be a 5 letter long “xxxxx”
(provide your team name too your tutors within the first two weeks of SEM2).
• The pages file names should be as follows:

1. Splash Screen: splash.html [Student 1]
2. Home Page: home.html [Student 2]
3. Volunteer: volunteer.html [Student 1]
4. Table: table.html [Student 2]
5. User Profile: profile.html [Student 4]
6. Feedback: feedback.html [Student 3]
7. Sitemap: sitemap.html [Student 4]
8. Team: team.html [Student 3]
9. Content page: content_ST1.html [Student 1]
   content_ST2.html [Student 2]
   content_ST3.html [Student 3]
   content_ST4.html [Student 4]
10. Page Editor: pageEditor_ST1.html [Student 1]
    pageEditor \_ST2.html [Student 2]
    pageEditor \_ST3.html [Student 3]
    pageEditor \_ST4.html [Student 4]
11. Validation Page: validation_ST1.html [Student 1]
    validation \_ST2.html [Student 2]
    validation \_ST3.html [Student 3]
    validation \_ST4.html [Student 4]
    The external CSS file to control the format of the entire website should be saved in the CWK folder with the
    name: style.css
    Provided you work well as a team you are advised to create a shared folder and use internal links to connect
    your pages. However, the folder structure suggested earlier can be used to create the navigation bar.
    5.15. Contract: Group Coursework Agreement
    To ensure equal contribution and the smooth completion of the coursework, each group must adhere to the
    following requirements:
    28

12. Group Meetings
    • Schedule and hold at least five group meetings (e.g., one per week).
    • Meetings should focus on progress updates, task delegation, and resolving any challenges.
13. Meeting Records
    For each meeting, the group must maintain detailed records that include:
    • Date/Time and Method: Specify whether the meeting was in person, online (e.g., Teams), or
    another format.
    • Purpose: Clearly state the objective of the meeting.
    • Attendance: Record which members were present.
    • Individual Contributions: Document contributions made by each group member during the
    meeting.
14. Reporting Non-Contribution
    • If a group member fails to attend meetings or does not contribute adequately, the issue must be
    reported to the seminar tutor.
    • The seminar tutor may impose penalties, including marks deductions, if warranted.
15. Mutual Group Coursework Agreement
    • All group members are required to sign the Group Coursework Agreement, committing to:
    o Actively participating in all assigned tasks.
    o Fulfilling their responsibilities as outlined in the agreement.

    • The signed agreement ensures accountability and promotes effective collaboration within the
    team.
16. Submission
    The completed Group Coursework Agreement, signed by all team members, must be submitted as
    part of the coursework. You can access the Group Coursework Agreement on Blackboard in the
    Assessment Folder.
17. Coursework Examination
    This coursework will be assessed based on the following components:
18. Implemented Webpages:
    • Each student is responsible for completing the webpages assigned to them as part of the group
    project.
19. Individual Report:
    • Each team member must submit a detailed report documenting the implementation of their
    assigned tasks.
    • This report will be included as content in the Page Editor’s section of the website.
20. In-Class Demonstration:
    29

• Each group is required to deliver a mandatory presentation of their website during the scheduled
computer seminar class, as outlined on Blackboard closer to the submission deadline.
• During the demonstration, team members must answer questions about the development of their
webpages.
• Important: Failure to attend the in-class demonstration will result in penalties. 7. Coursework Submission Instructions
This coursework requires a single submission containing the following components:

1. Compressed Files:
   • Upload in your submission a compressed file (e.g., ZIP) containing:
   o All website files (HTML, CSS files and images located within the folders you've been working
   on in your local drive)

2. Individual Report
3. Team Mutual Contract for Teamwork Accountability:
   •
   Upload in your submission a contract that ensures accountability and effective collaboration
   within the team signed by all teams members.
4. Marking scheme
   The success of this group coursework hinges greatly on effective collaboration among all team members,
   with each contributing equally to its completion. Each team member has been assigned tasks of equal level
   of difficulty, and upon successful completion of all tasks, they are expected to receive a collective
   coursework mark (as shown in Table 1 below). To ensure fairness and objectivity in evaluating individual
   contributions to the group coursework, a meticulous marking system has been devised that will be available
   on Blackboard. The weekly practice tests contribute 5% toward the individual component of the Group
   Coursework grade. For more details, refer to the module handbook available on Blackboard (BB).
